Natasha's Portfolio

Overview
This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills and experience as a mixed media artist. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a responsive design, animations, and interactive elements.

Design: I created a visual design concept using Adobe XD and Figma, selecting a colour scheme, typography, and imagery that reflects my artistic style.
Development: I wrote the HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript code for the website, using a combination of vanilla JavaScript and CSS animations to create interactive elements.
Testing: I tested the website on various devices and browsers to ensure responsiveness and compatibility.
Challenges
During development, I faced several challenges:

Responsive design: Ensuring that the website's layout and design adapted to different screen sizes and devices was a major challenge.
Animation and interaction: Creating smooth and engaging animations and interactions using JavaScript and CSS required a lot of trial and error.

Used online resources: I consulted online tutorials, documentation, and forums to learn new techniques and troubleshoot issues.
Tested and iterated: I continuously tested and refined my code to ensure that it worked as intended.
Sought feedback: I asked for feedback from peers and mentors to identify areas for improvement.
